With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\\nThis major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical\\nmodels, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for thelasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter onmethods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.\\nTrevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at\\nStanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshiranideveloped generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS andinvented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of thevery successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.\\n›springer.comSTATISTICS\\nisbn 978-0-387-84857-0Trevor Hastie • Robert Tibshirani • Jerome Friedman\\nThe Elements of Statictical Learning\\nHastie • Tibshirani • Friedman\\nSecond Edition', metadata={'source': 'mixed_data/element_of_SL.pdf', 'page': 0})"

      "nology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\n",
      "This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical\n",
      "models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for thelasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter onmethods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.\n",

      "Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshiranideveloped generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS andinvented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of thevery successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.\n",

      "nology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\n",

      "models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for thelasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter onmethods for “wide” data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.\n",

      "Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshiranideveloped generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS andinvented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of thevery successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.\n",

The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, supportvector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of thistopic in any book.\n",

The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings butare often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas inthese areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, theemphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberaluse of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interestedin data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning(prediction) to unsupervised learning.
